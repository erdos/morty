# Stencil template engine

Stencil is a templating engine to produce Office Open XML (mostly Microsoft Office's Word `.docx` files)
from within Java programs. It has a simple syntax so you will not need programmers to write or modify
document templates.

You can find the project on [Stencil's GitHub](https://github.com/erdos/stencil) page.
